Implementation of 32-bit MIPS Processor using Verilog HDL
Implemented a 32-bit MIPS processor in Verilog. Skillfully integrating gate-level, Dataflow, and behavioral modeling techniques.
Orchestrated a 5-stage pipeline architecture encompassing stages like Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Writeback, effectively optimizing processor performance.
